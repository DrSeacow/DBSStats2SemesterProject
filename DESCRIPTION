Description: With this website, I hope to consolidate everything needed for the semester project for the Stats 2 R lab. This includes my lab assignments throughout the semester, the "proof-of-concepts" asked for on the "semester project" tab of the course website, as well as a slide-deck and my R package, immuno.analyze. About immuno.analyze: This website Processes .CSV data files output by the ImageJ "custom macros" plugin (Timothy and Forlano, 2019) used for analysis of immunolabeled tissue. Functions available for analyzing: A) Proportion of tissue containing fluorescent label, B) Number of cells in tissue containing fluorescent label, and C) Average intensity of a given cell containing fluorescent label. Can be used on single-channel or colocalized data. Functions available for separately analyzing three coronal planes of tissue, and for averaging the three planes together.
